# OSHW-Multimeter

First steps towards a fully open source hardware multimeter. This is the main repository for the open source hardware multimeter, inspired by a thread at the [eevblog-website](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/oshw/open-source-multimeter/ "eevblog forum thread").


#### The project is currently in the early requirements phase. Contributors are very welcome to join the process and discuss the requirements and early design documents.


### Organization and File Tree

Every top-level directory starts with a 2 digit number XX followed by an underscore to show its position in the design process, eg. "01_High_Level_Requirements"


### Current main contributors:
